david and forrest notes
=======================

~ 1:00 Intro matter, push a clearer separation betw. perosnal intro and one second intto

~ 2.00 'we're going to walk you through the arc of production...'

2-3: good intro, needs a slide.

3.45 - 4: numbers would be nice

[Delivery: make sure to clearly message the highlight ponts, like 'need to be agile']

5.45 throw up a link to lico's vault talk

7.30 component stuff : you can message the 'pros talking to pros' stuff harder

[Over the video from 7.x to 13.x: cut away to slides for important notes]

15.30: good example!

sec 3
======

18.10 - might want an infographic... is this a wrapper object?  May need a clear strategy intro slide somewhere

19.30 - again, good candidate for infographics

21.XX - i'm curious about how this differs from standard inheritance if at all

[overall: this section might need some block diagrams]

sec 4
======

[last bit is cool, the 'keeping animation' thing is huge, so treat it as a teaser throughout]

sec 5
======

33.45 -- xplant is important, needs infographic or sequence

[does reanimator make DENSE or SPARSE retargeted data?]

sec 6
=====
[ push the 'reanimator is basic' message up to the top]

39.30 -- need some high level intro.

[Try to find some 1-2 sentence top level goodie for each tool so it's clear]
[this demo is a little flabby - it's cool but not easily actionable.  Too demo-ish. Maybe  you need to walk through these tools as a problem-solution approach pointing back to the way things are written!]


[wrap of that section is good. More of that!]

sec 7
=====


[Overall: sections need stronger theming, intro, outro]
[Overall: the 'save animtions when re-rigging' thing is killer, needs to be emphasized]
[Really needs a conclusion!!!!!]
