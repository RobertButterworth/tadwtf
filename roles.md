==========================================================================

* TA Roles
	* Role, identity are fluid
	* depends on personalities and project needs:
		- ex 1 : Doug and I :  1 % tech and 99% tech
		- ex 2 : Paul: The keeper of secret knowledge
		- ex 3 : Graham, Wes G:  commander of the Kamikaze airforce
		- ex 4 : Jamie M: lone genius, off in the ether doing stuff.

	* diplomat
		* Get engineers, artists talking
			* translate requests into actionable items
	* pioneer
		* Figure out how an idea can be achieved
		* prototypes and proofs-of-concepts
		* Often very involved in planning, less so in late stage
	* troubleshooter
		* content debugging
		* tools debugging
		* now we need to fix these 900 files, who’s with me?
	* manager
		* Keeping other TAs working
		* usual schedule / manager stuff
			* interesting because TA work is very fragmented
			* “interrupt driven”
	* planner:
		* how do we make this?
		* how do we make this _efficiently_
		* What’s going to bite us in the ass?
	* Tools dev:
		* fight for more creativity and less bs
		* fight for focusing on important stuff
			* saving button clicks is useful
			* saving wasted days is critical
	* Nanny
		* Explaining the mysteries
		* reassuring nervous artists
		* Engineers are right - its often user error
			* but if they make a system where errors are easy its their fault, not the artists’
	* Butler
		* Be there when called
		* biggest difference between engineers and tas!

Getting the most out of your TAD:
* Wargaming
	* Going to engineers with requests gives them all the power to approve or disapprove
	* Going in with a plan lets you set the agenda
	* Get TAD in on the artistic side of the plan, pick technologies that support that
	* Then pad your request list a bit :)
	* There will still be pushback
	* but if you start with a plan, you’re negotiating, not begging.
— 
* Use your TAs to improve the process
	* constantly look for bullshit
		* what wastes time?
		* what wastes effort?
	* Be on the lookout for stockholm syndrome
		* Arena example
		* Bungie example
		* When artists are too beaten down they don’t even see the pain any more
	* Invest in fixing the process, not bandaids
		* Zipper polygon example
	* Invest in automation, not human wave attacks
		* State of Decay vs Halo
		* Wes anecdote
		* You’ll lose good people if you give them awful work to do
			* true for artists too!
		* There will still alway be situations that need human judgement and eyeballs
			* Like Normandy beach -sometimes you have to make a frontal assault
			* But if you do it every time you’ll be defeated
* Groom your tech-art department
	* TA’s can be insecure:
		* Renaissance man? Or just bad programmer — bad artist?
	* Help them by setting high standards
		* Expect:
			* Good process vision 
			* Reliable tools
			* High quality service
	* Don't ghettoize
		- if you treat TA as a silo it's not able to do its job
	* look for people you can trust, then trust them
		* Don't use it as a dumping ground!
* Some companies don’t know what to do with TAs’
	* programmers don’t like people who know a little programming
	* Artists don’t like people with lesser art skills
	* If those prejudices lead to 343-style human wave tactics you’re in trouble.
		* Talented applicants will stay away
		* You’ll get more sad-sacks
		* self-fulfilling prophecy
	* You have a hand in building that group, and you should always be looking for quality
		* And keeping an eye on artists in house who would benefit from specializing
