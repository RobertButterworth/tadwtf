themes

Themes:
* The waterline:
	* are you contributing? Or filling in for other people's mistakes
	* Don't put people below the waterline
		- it's cruel 
		- it's counterproductive: nothing get's better
		- 
* The great compromiser:
	* reconciling different needs and interests
	* need to know enough about both jobs to do them well

* "Watercolor"
	* Boundaries are fluid, hard to delimit
		- eg on State of Decay I designed the pipeline and also did production

* Renaissance man
	- Not just because you know multiple things
	- But also because you pioneer things
		— Ex: alberti and the history of perspective
			* discovered by tinkerers 
			* popularized by systematizers
			* revolutionized the way art was made
			* "tips and tricks"
			* Craft and Theory are complimentary
				Combining both opens new doors
				Being a “Renaissance Person” isn’t enough
				Multi-skilled people make cool discoveries….
				…but without a system, discoveries remain curiosities
				How do you liberate creative energies?
				Exploration followed by packaging
				Make the fruits of discovery available to the crafts-people

* process vision
	- Seeing making stuff as a system, not an act
		— identify time wasters
		— identify one-way gates
		— fight for short, straight pipelines
	- Negotiation does not work
		— "We just won't do that" is a lie
			* Phinney story
			* Moonrise story
	- What works is designing the process right
		— simple
		— flexible
		— as linear as possible
	- Example: level editing a shooter game
		— Socom vs TF2
* talent for abstraction
	- Learn to see the visually significant cues that other artists see
	- ... and translate them in to tech.
	- Example: de-construct an image for the audience
		— glancing highlights
		— direct, indirect, specular, ambient etc
		— see contours and gradients as functions
		— see blend modes, etc
	- Not about just knowing what knobs to pull
		— also knowing what to ask for
	- Example:
		— "carved out of soap"
		— translate into:
			* soft contours 
			* soft terminators
			* lots of mid tones
* tolerance for chaos
	- Some engineers are "just so" people
		— don't like the boat rocked
	- TAs are the opposite:
		— "Interrupt driven"
	- Have to be able to deal with sudden chaos
		— psychologically 
			* don't freak out
			* Ship sank? Build another!
			* example:
				- rebuilding hit boxes.
		— organizationally
			* good backlog
			* example:
				- good email reporting tools
		— technologically
			* good library of tricks up your sleeve
			* know how to use a roll of duct tape.
			* Example: Crytek files lib
* Good memory
	- Somebody has to remember how things work
		— development is not linear or routine
		— we don't usually know how to do half of it
		— we imrovise and move on 
		— god help us if we have to go back
	- It's likely to be the TA (see "memory alpha") who remembers
	- Documents fail
		— More tools, less  process!
		— More tools, less documentation
		— if it can be automatic, it should be
	
* Guilds, secrecy
	- medieval tradition
		— secretive
		— local
		— family based
		— inefficient!
	- renaissance
		— formal
		— literary
		— repeatable!
	- We constantly struggle between these two
		— guild life is actually kind of fun
		— it's tight, it's us-vs-them
		— it's also more secure
			* artists keeping secrets
		— But the open economy is vastly more efficient
			* cheaper
			* lower risk
			* no run-over-by-bus problem
				- 343 story
		— Moral Q: are we putting people out of a job?
			* No - if we could do it, so could somebody else
			* If we make things more streamlined we're making the people with us more valuable
* Innovation vs iteration
	- Regular artists work best in iteration
		— try, view, judge, tweak, repeat
	- TA's need to innovate
		— new ways to work
		— new ideas to look at
		— proof of concept
	- These are complementary, but appeal to different people
		— TA = easily bored
		— Artists = hard to make them stop
		— innovators create a new process
		— iterators make it sing
* Department or not?
	- I don't like departments
	- but they can be a necessary evil
		— engineers / designers don't always want to hear from artists
			* "Lazy artists" story
		— It helps if the whole company knows that somebody is there to speak for the process
	- OTOH the relationship between art and ta is special
		— if you're not close, it's not working
		— TA exists to make art more productive
