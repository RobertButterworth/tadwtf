==========

- intro screen would be cool with some inapropriate military stuff
- need a little more 'advicey stuff' in the intro material around the 10 minute mark
- in the early images, stress the development over time
	- underwater level image, strong theming
	- a 'moral of the story' for each image - eg, you can find what you want if you do research
- "key visual principles"
	- tie in back to the subject matter

> don't need to read slide titles.

- image layering is really good. maybe add text to the builds

> you did several palettes, good organizing principle.

> moral of the northern lights story? Tie it in in to the lessons of cultural work

> moral of the fox story - you can push back against the source too

- relation to the source.
