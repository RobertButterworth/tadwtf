prologue
========
- I started this talk as a discussion of my job
	- but that's not too interesting to this audience
	- instead
		- how to get the most out of a department
		- TA is a new field
			- 2006 article
			- 2009 trip
			- now recognized - but often mis-used
		- So this talk is about
			- Overview of what TA is for
			- How to be a good consumer of TA services
			- Keeping your TA department in shape
			
I wanna be will

-  ![Russian space shot]
-  ![Cell shot]
-  I really wanted to do something similar
	+  because TA is hard thing to pin down

MacGyver
======================
* MacGuvyer ![MacGyver photo](http://www.edsocialmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/macgyver.jpg)
	- resourceful
	- TA's love solving problems
		— we are usually self-selected
		— for stubborness and curiosity!
		— Its why we make good debuggers
		— Who ya gonna call?
	- But:
		+ _hair joke here_
		- he's a loner
		- we work with others 

Leonardo
==========
* segue: renaissance man >> ![Leonardo](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/anthonykosner/files/2013/08/leonardo-da-vinci-06.jpg)
	- the "technical"  in technical art makes it sound like it's all engineering
	- Leonardo is proof idea that you can be technical and creative
	- ![mona lisa]
		+ We all know he painted the mona lisa
	- ![tech drawing]
		+ But he was also an inventor and tinkerer.
		+ And he was entirely self taught, which is true for most TAs
	- This image works because we're crazy half-and-half hybrids
		+ we can talk to artists and to programmers;  #hybrid
		+ Sometimes, jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none
	- TA's work to bring art and engineering together
		+ because we speak both languages, we are often the negotiators or diplomats 

The Healer
==========
* segue: But what about teamwork?   ![RPG image with mage, thief, fighter, cleric](http://site.worldatplaygames.com/images/other/munchkin/classes.jpg)
	- RPG quad
	- Emphasizes teamwork  #service
	- Engineering = Wizard.  The glass cannon
	- Design = Theif.  Leaves work up to everybody else
	- Art = Fighter.  In the trenches
	- TA = Cleric. The support class.
	- Good metaphor! but service means more than spamming heals
		— nobody likes playing as just a buff buddy

Mr Carson
=============
* Segue: service != spamming heals!
	- ![ Downton abbey / Mr Carson](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/130/2/c/downton_abbey___promotional_poster_by_emreunayli-d4z89pw.jpg) 
	- Service which knows its own domain very well.   #logistics
	- gives deference, but expects to be recognized for expertise
	- the core of that expertise is in logistics and planning
		+ making sure we take on achievable tasks
		+ making it easy to achieve those tasks.
	- is it sexy? not always
	- but it makes the sexy stuff possible	 	 

Tron
=====
* Segue:  I almost wanted to use that as the final image
	- partly because it's funny
	- But I realized, at long last, that I already had the right image
	- it's a T-Shirt you can order from tech-artists.org 
	- ![t-a t-shirt](http://image.spreadshirt.com/image-server/v1/compositions/18837146/views/1,width=280,height=280,appearanceId=4.png/i-am-a-tech-artist-standard-weight-tee-any-color_design.png)
	- And that sums it up:
		- TA = "making artists more productive"
		- The most precious resource in any production is creative #brain_cells
		- we make sure they don't get wasted on BS.
 
What is a TA?
=============
* Summation:
	- TA is a complex role
	- But it has 4 major elements
		— #problem solving
		— #diplomacy
		— #service
		— #logistics / planning

save the braincells
===================
![Steve jobs closet](http://allaboutstevejobs.com/persona/steveathome/05.jpg)
- Creative thinking is a precious, finite resource
	+ don't waste it on BS stuff
	+ Focus on story, moood, character
	+ Not on file names, check boxes
- All boil down to one big thing:
	+ Making artists more productive


> This should be about the 10 minute mark - transition to 'ta consumer' section

Consumer reports
================================
* Segue : Ta is important. It's a high value service. So you should learn how to use it. 
	- Being an informed consumer
 	- I want to show you how to be an informed consumer of TA services.
	- How to understand what TA's do  in the long view
	- How to get the most out of your TAs 

> Graphic wanted

Strategy & tactics
====================
*  #Strategy vs #tactics (PROCESS)  >> Probably needs a wrapup infographic
	- It's a big topic, so I'll have to look at in in a pretty general way
		+ not talking about techie details
	- To keep it simple, I'm going to divide TA up into two (arbitrary) halves
		+ #Strategy: 
			- this is big-picture stuff, year-to-year stuff
			- logistics, planning, bullshit checking
			- the "Mister carson side"
			- emphasis on picking right workflows and tools design
			- Ta's good because they can see the tech and production side!
		+ #Tactics
			- the day to day side		
			- the "heal spam" side
			- daily contacts, small jobs, help desk work
			- this is small picture stuff: keeping people happy day to day
			

The right balance
=================
* you need both!
	+ Both are important
		- too much tactics doesn't achieve big savings or major new ways to work
			+ Often artists only want this, don't want bigger pictures stuff
		- too much strategy can leave the artists feeling abandoned and the TAs out of touch.
			+ Often TA's get too heads down, too much like 'programmers'
	+ balance shifts over the course of the project
		- more strategy early, more tactics late
		- start with planning, experimentation, prototypes
		- over time, move into maintain-and-explain mode
	- Finding the right balance is a an important key to getting the most out of TA  #advice

Horror stories
===============
* Segue:
	- I've been in the business 20 years
	- Friends said I could do the whole talk with nothing but horror stories
	
catalogue of horrors
========================
* zipper levels
	- giant maya file
	- long load time
	- nothing like WYSIWYG
	- awfule importer
		-  crashing due to error reports!
* bungie lighing
	- overnight bake time
	- artists believed they had precise control 
	- but they didn't!
	- tail chasing
 * QC files
	- Go ask somebody to do it for you is not a strategy
* bungie materials
	- a ten year old email thread is not documentaion. 	

Hallmarks of bad strategy
===========================
* What is bad strategy? 
	- Could be bad tech, or just bad process
		+ usually it's both
		+ No matter how you get there the symptoms are the same
	+  process that is mysterious
		- Bungie materials story
	+  process that is too cumbersome
		- Valve materials story
	+ Workflows that get in the way of iteration
		- sluggish 
		- fragile or unreliable
	+ Workflows that aren't  collaborative
		- Ben W' Photoshop files
	+ In short: bad strategy gets in the way of artists doing their jobs
	+ Ta's are very passionate about these things
		- our job involves cleaning up after these messes
		- So we take a big interest in fixing them

Good strategy, courtesy of TA:
==============================
*  Good example of how TA's can drive a succesful strategy:
	-  Changing bungie character process
	-  Old way:
		+  iterate in concept
		+  model
		+  texture
		+  review & approve
		+  rig
		+  animate
		+  Oops! back to step 1!
	-  New way
		+  iterate in concept
		+  Massing model
		+  Concept animation
		+  Review and approve
		+  Texture
		+  Rig and animate
		+  Yay!
		
hallmarks of good strategy
============================
> This slide needs tightening up

*  Strategy has many details, but Good strategies...
	-  Are understandable!	
		-  TAs can help more, if they contribute more
		-  That's why I like this kind of exporter dialog ![1 button exporter dialog image]
		-  instead of this ![typical Fbx with all options visible]
	-  Are efficient
		+  One button and go is good
		+ But there are many other ways to make things efficient
			+  automatic naming and file placement
			+  visual browsers with tagging instead of folder hierarchies
			+  Search and replace in data files
	-  Are collaborative and iterative
		+  CTRL+G is good !

Strategy reprise
=================
- picking the right battles is the key to a successful production
- you need good strategy to preserve the dedication and love of your artists
-  You should expect... no, demand! -- good strategic insights from your TAD 
-  What an AD should look for
	+  Good understanding of tech
	+  Good workflow instincts
	+  Good negotiating skills
	+  Fighting for users, against hand-waviness or over-optimism

TAs and strategy
=================	
*  TA's are good at strategy because
	-  They know both sides of the equation [#leonardo]
		+  Can talk to both sides
		+  Can help negotiate production decisions
			- Girling story
			-  Jeff's recolor story
				+  sometimes the two views are very different!
	-  They have production know-how 
		+  eating your own dogfood is good
			- TAs do; tools programmers usually don't
	-  They've usually seen the results of mistakes close up!
		+  bad decisions often land in our laps
		+  We know the hard truth:
			- no handshake agreement lasts
			- everything is iterative
			- yesterday's stretch goal is tomorrow's front line feature

Strategy and organization
==============================
-  Is TA a department or group?
-  Personally I don't much care
	-  if you're in a situation where TOE is important, you're probably already in trouble
-  However, heres one useful principle to keep in mind
	- You want the TAD in discussions where process is important!
		- new features
		- new workflows
		- scalability
	-  The key thing that matter is **making the team pay attention to artists time and how it is spent.**
	-  It it takes a title to do that, then great 	

Tactics
============
> this needs a better transition

*  Segue: Now time for about tactics
-  Like strategy there are a million details we don't want to cover.
-  When I say tactics, you should hear "help" or "service"  #cleric
-   tactics matters
	+  small improvements are the core of the bond between TA and Art
	+  show that problems are understood
	+  and artist time is valued
	+  This is the most common form of tech-art
		-  in too many companies its the only form.


Tactics is the foundation of strategy
=======================================
-  To some degree it's just because little details matter
	+  All artists know that
	+  Saving a few seconds here or there, avoiding a minor annoyance can make a big psychological difference to your work
-	But more importantly, you need the intel
	+	You don't know what's going on if you're not in daily contact
		-	I struggle with this all the time...
		-	Artists don't report bugs!	
-   People don't always see the big strategic savings, but they see the little things.

Artists don't look out for themselves
=====================================
> possible gimmicks: Ostalgia? 8-bit games? Both?

+  Artists are very conservative
+  Vulnerable to stockholm syndome
+  Example: Arena Net animations
	- Everthing in one file??
	- And if you change something at the beginning, you have to move all subsequent keys????
	- And.... NO ONE COMPLAINED.
	- People can be get used to everything
	- they missed East Germany

That's why you need to be out there...
=======================================
* Segue: Moral of the Anet story:
	- artists don't always stick up for themselves
	- you need to get their trust to make lives better 
	-  So you need to invest in tactics - aka, investing in service - to protect the ability of the strategy side to deliver
	-   If you want to implement new better workflows, you have to prove yourself to the artists

Being in the trenches
======================
*  Segue: since artists don't stick up for themselves, be proactive
	-  TAs need to spend time with their clients
		+  observing
		+  asking questions
		+  answering questions
		+  helping out
	-  If they lose touch they turn into just plain old tools programmers

Good tactics = good relationships
==================================
*  Good tactics boils down to relationships:
	-  be friendly
	-  be knowledgeable
	-  be helpful
	-  be responsive
	-  above all, be _there_
	- >> keep the joke about "if being a grouchy genius is needed, we have programmers for that"	

What an AD can look for:
==========================
* If your not in the trenches it's hard to judge those relationships...
	- but here are some things you can look for
	- Does every crash generate an automatic email?
		- .. and do TA's respond?
	- Are tools released with testing and validation
		- .. or just dumped into a network share?
	- Do TA's know how to help?
		+ there are lots of forms
			+ Good person-to-person skills
			+ Asking good questions
			+ Prioritizing 	
			+ training and education
			+ docs...
	- How Do TA's take and implement requests?
		+ is it transparent? Is it well managed

Time management
===================
- Good tactics are not something you can just schedule
- service is a constant drain on attention
- Post-it story
- it's hard to keep focused on big picture items
	+ I tend to rotate people in an out of the hotseat
	+ so there is fast response
	+ and tactical knowledge
- Key point: don't siloize! 		 	

> Does this work better one slide later? How to transition from 'tactics' to 'crisis management...?


Tactics reprise
=================
+ Good tactics is all about service
	- saving [#braincells] 
	- keeping people happy and productive
+ The hardest task for TA's is balancing strategy and tactics
	- Strategy, like engineering, tends to take lots of time
	- tension between doing service and complex code
	- TA's need to resist temptation to vanish into the ether
		- constant contact is good for morale
		- constant contact gives TAs better knowledge of the problems
		- constant contact builds political capital!
	- Should be as embedded as possible

Crisis management
===================
* Seque:  we've talked about the balance between #strategy and #tactics
 	+ but, to extend the warmongering metaphor, "No plan survives contact the enemy"
	- The other big complicating factor in TA life is the balance between the planned and the unplanned.
	- Good strats will fail. 
	- Good service will not magic away production crises
	- Managing  crises is a *critical* part of TA

Sh*t Happens
==============
*  Sure, nobody expect's a crisis.  But they are inevitable
	+ Most common strategies all have weaknesses:
	+ 'we won't do that' ?
		- oh yes you will	!
			- design and tech imperatives are all fluid
			- publishers, designers, and playtest feedback all have a say!
		- Moonrise character distances
		- SOD cinematics
	+ 'this tool will make that not a problem'
		- tools are software. All software has bugs
		- tools have long lead times, can't adapt to sudden changes
			- eg, UE 4 removes script support
		- tools, like games, don't arrive on time.
	+ 'our engine is perfect'
		- no its not
		- the 'perfect' description of the finished game != the perfect working environment
			- eg, Bungie tags
		- too optimized data is hard to change. 
		
TA = FEMA
==========
* So, crises are inevitable
	- When things go bad, TA is the first line of defence
		+ time to rename files?
		+ time to track down budget over runs?
		+ time to change contents of hundreds of files?
		+ Call a TA!
	- and things always go bad.  Always.
	- This is almost a job in itself
		- Modern productions are too big to keep in anyones head
			-	tons of assets
			-	even more dependencies

Disaster response is a tough job
===================================
- by definition, it's not planned
- hard to improve, because every crisis is different
- high time costs
- Even so, Manual fixups have to be the last line of defence, not the first
	- ta's have to maximize their own productivity so they can maximise yours

Disaster preparedness
=====================
- Up front investments
	- people skills
		- all TAs need to be able to do their own automation, full stop  #macguyver
		- scripting < hard core programming, but it's essential
		-it's the only way to speed up massive drudge work
	- open file formats
		+ ex: level search and replace
	- automatable tools
		+ no tool is front line ready if it doesn't have production flexibility
		+ Maya example: everything is scriptable; vs old Max.
	- asset tracking and metadata
		+ all forms of automation work easier with this
	- Prevent bad source data
		- p4 triggers to exclude bad files
		- warn on out-of-date files
		-  can't check in files with bad references, etc.
-   Cynicism
	- "We just wont do that" rarely works
	-  when it does, it's not always a good thing

Be prepared!
============
* Important difference: Disaster prep vs lurching from one crisis to another  
	- production always involves crises
	- TA's should be there to do the worst cleanup work
	- **BUT** working this way all the time is a failure
		+ It's demoralizing for TAs
		+ It enables bad behavior in other departments
	- Wes G. anecdote
	+ You’ll lose good people if you give them awful work to do
		- true for artists too!
	- Like Normandy beach -sometimes you have to make a frontal assault
		- But if you do it every time you’ll be defeated
		- back reference to #strategy.

	+ Reminder: close contact with art is the key
		- You need this for three reasons
	 		- Can't do good tactics if you don't know the customers
			- Can't do good strategy if you don't know the way things are made
			- In the crises you need to be able to pitch in where needed, business card be damned
		- Don't want to waltz in with no knowledge of ground truths

Conclusion
===========
-	TA is a complex role
-	Short history, no easy models to use
-	Boils down to a simple idea:
	+	TAs are there to make other people more productive
	
Getting the most out of TA's
============================
- Make good use of their ability to drive content strategy
	+   better tools and workflows
	+   avoiding bad decisions
- Build close relationships between TA and art
	+ constant contact
	+ good service from TAs
	+ buy-in from art
- Be prepared for crises
	+ Assume things will go wrong, plan accordingly
	+ But don't use that as an excuse for drudgery
