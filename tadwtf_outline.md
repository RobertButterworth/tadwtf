Hooks
I : What's a TA?
===================
* intro / credits
* Aim of the talk:
	- how to get the most out of a department
	- you could be a TAD or an AD, almost the same
	- talk falls in 3 big buckets
		+ Overview of what TA is for
		+ How to be a good consumer of TA services
		+ Keeping your TA department in shape
* What's TA? damned if i know!
	- Will Wright hook  ![WW photo](http://img.tedcdn.com/r/images.ted.com/images/ted/0aa66122bf487af64e943f4e4c3810fdd4d13c2a_1600x1200.jpg?)
- Litany of failed metaphors >> Ideally 2 or 3 images per section!
	* MacGuvyer ![MacGuvyer photo](http://www.edsocialmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/macgyver.jpg)
		- #resourceful
		- TA's love solving problems
			— we are usually self-selected
			— for stubborness and curiosity!
			— Its why we make good debuggers
			— Who ya gonna call?
		- But:
			- he's a loner >> hair jokes
			- we work with others 
	* segue: renaissance man >> ![Leonardo](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/anthonykosner/files/2013/08/leonardo-da-vinci-06.jpg)
		- the "technical"  in technical art makes it sound like it's all engineering
		- Leonardo is proof idea that you can be technical and creative
		- ![mona lisa]
			+ We all know he painted the mona lisa
		- ![tech drawing]
			+ But he was also an inventor and tinkerer.
			+ And he was entirely self taught, which is true for most TAs
		- This image works because we're crazy half-and-half hybrids
			+ we can talk to artists and to programmers;  #hybrid
			+ Sometimes, jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none
		- TA's work to bring art and engineering together
			+ because we speak both languages, we are often the negotiators or diplomats 
	* segue: But what about teamwork?   ![RPG image with mage, thief, fighter, cleric](http://site.worldatplaygames.com/images/other/munchkin/classes.jpg)
		- RPG quad
		- Emphasizes teamwork  #service
		- Engineering = Wizard.  The glass cannon
		- Design = Theif.  Leaves work up to everybody else
		- Art = Fighter.  In the trenches
		- TA = Cleric. The support class.
		- Good metaphor! but service means more than spamming heals
			— nobody likes playing as just a buff buddy
	* Segue: service != spamming heals!
		- ![ Downton abbey / Mr Carson](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/130/2/c/downton_abbey___promotional_poster_by_emreunayli-d4z89pw.jpg) 
		- Service which knows its own domain very well.   #logistics
		- gives deference, but expects to be recognized for expertise
		- the core of that expertise is in logistics and planning
			+ making sure we take on achievable tasks
			+ making it easy to achieve those tasks.
		- is it sexy? not always
		- but it makes the sexy stuff possible	 	 
	* Segue:  I almost wanted to use that as the final image
		- partly because it's funny
		- But I realized, at long last, that I already had the right image
		- it's a T-Shirt you can order from tech-artists.org 
		- ![t-a t-shirt](http://image.spreadshirt.com/image-server/v1/compositions/18837146/views/1,width=280,height=280,appearanceId=4.png/i-am-a-tech-artist-standard-weight-tee-any-color_design.png)
		- And that sums it up:
			- TA = "making artists more productive"
			- The most precious resource in any production is creative #brain_cells
			- we make sure they don't get wasted on BS.
	* Summation:
		- TA is a complex role
		- But it has 4 major elements
			— #problem solving
			— #diplomacy
			— #service
			— #logistics / planning
		- All boil down to one big thing:
			+ Making artists more productive

>> still about 12 mins.  Good.

II:  setting expectations  (>> TOO LONG!! 30 mins!)
================================
* Segue : Ta is important. It's a high value service. So you should learn how to use it. 
	- Being an informed consumer
 	- I want to show you how to be an informed consumer of TA services.
 	- Give you ways of looking at what ta's do 
 	- so you can ask for the right kinds of help
 	- and get the most value out of these people who are here to make your life easier.
 
*  #Strategy vs #tactics (PROCESS)  >> Probably needs a wrapup infographic
	- It's a big topic, so I'll have to look at in in a pretty general way
		+ not talking about techie details
	- To keep it simple, I'm going to divide TA up into two (slightly arbitrary) halves
		+ #Strategy: 
			- this is big-picture stuff, year-to-year stuff
			- logistics, planning, bullshit checking
			- the "Mister carson side"
			- emphasis on picking right workflows and tools design
			- Ta's good because they can see the tech and production side!
		+ #Tactics
			- the day to day side		
			- the "heal spam" side
			- daily contacts, small jobs, help desk work
			- this is small picture stuff: keeping people happy day to day
	- you need both!
		+ Both are important, as you'll see
			- balance shifts over the course of the project
			- more strategy early, more tactics late
			- But both they are mutually reinforcing
			- And equally vital
— Strategy and tactics anecdotes:
	* Segue: let's illustrate strategy with a bad example: Zipper level design process
		- it was not a process at all,  it was just the way things happened to get done
			+ poor feedback looks: weeks not hours
			+ hard to parallelize
		- Low productivity
			- Done in maya
				- mistake right off - maya is bad a this sort of thing
			- 10 minute load times
			- could not show all the placements
		- Bad feedback
			+ Maya file was not wysiwyg
			+ long export times
			- exports generates so many errors they had to rebuild the exporter... to accomodate more error messages
			- lots of working in the dark
		* Turnaround time > 6 weeks
			- UV changes
			- moving roads
			- trial and error exports
		* Impossible to fine tune
	+ Bad example 2: Bungie lightmaps
		- segue: sometimes the problem is not design or engineering:  
		- sometimes it's artists!
			- all the artists wanted exact control
			- But the reality was a fixed pie
			- Couldn't make them budge
		— result: a huge waste of time, energy, #braincells
			- Results indistinguishable from auto-mapping
			- probably cost $250,000 per year  (10% of c-o-e for 20ish artists & TA support)
			- More importantly, it affected art choices 
				+ less time to think 	
				+ risk aversion
			- There are times when great outcome is worth sacrificing for... but this was not one of them!
	+  There is no such thing as a perfect pipeline
		-  there are always bugs
		-  always rickety improvisations
		-  always bad guesses about the future.
		-  But you can make this better if you have good strats.
	*  Good example of strategy:
		-  Hat tip: Dhunt
		-  Changing bungie character process
		-  Old way:
			+  iterate in concept
			+  model
			+  texture
			+  review & approve
			+  rig
			+  animate
			+  Oops! back to step 1!
		-  New way
			+  iterate in concept
			+  Massing model
			+  Concept animation
			+  Review and approve
			+  Texture
			+  Rig and animate
			+  Yay!
	* Good example of #strategy >> Screen shot series, this is probably 4 'slides'
		— State of decay problems:
			- Big open world game
				— has 16 square km
				— 40,000 objects placed in the world
				— And parkour-style movement
			— And a team of 20
		— Design wanted to hand-place the markup
			- it's fast and easy
			- we can tweak it!
			- They were thinking "next milestone", ie, tactics
		— I said no
			- I was thinking "next year": strategy
			- the data was unnatural.  What is an oriented line?
			- even if we did it once, we could never manage it
			- and we ended up rebuilding the world 2.5 times
			- We build the markup into the tools
		- End result: we shipped the game, and it more or less worked.
			+ not perfect. Some assets could not be reused
			+ needed work from art, TA and engineering
			+ But it made the game shippable w/ tiny team
			+ low cost in #brain_cells
		- #Strategy saves the day
— Strategy reprise:
	* Moral of all 4 stories:
		- picking the right battles is the key to a successful production
		- you need good strategy to preserve #braincells
		- Not everything can be highest quality
		- Not everything can be hand tweaked to a high gloss
		- Every artists knows this while working
			- do don't forget it when thinking about how the production is designed
		-  You should expect... no, demand! -- good strategic insights from your TAD 	
	*  TA's are good at strategy because
		-  They know both sides of the equation #leonardo
			+  Can talk to both sides
			+  Can help negotiate production decisions
				-  Marcus' physics story
				-  Gabe's 'intuition' story (? maybe)
				-  Jeff's recolor story
					+  sometimes the two views are very different!
		-  They have production know-how 
			+  eating your own dogfood is good
				- TAs do; tools programmers usually don't
				- Ben's photoshop file story
		-  They've usually seen the results of mistakes close up!
			+  bad decisions often land in our laps
			+  We know the hard truth:
				- no handshake agreement lasts
				- everything is iterative
				- yesterday's stretch goal is tomorrow's front line feature
	* Side note: Strategy and organization
		-  Is TA a department or group?
		-  Personally I don't much care
			-  if you're in a situation where TOE is important, you're probably already in trouble
		-  However, heres one useful principle to keep in mind
			- You want the TAD in discussions where process is important!
				- new features
				- new workflows
				- scalability
			-  The key thing that matter is **making the team pay attention to artists time and how it is spent.**
			-  It it takes a title to do that, then great 	
	*  Segue: Now time for about tactics
		-  Like strategy there are a million details we don't want to cover.
		-  When I say tactics, you should hear "help" or "service"  #cleric
		-   tactics matters
			+  small improvements are the core of the bond between TA and Art
			+  show that problems are understood
			+  and artist time is valued
	* Tactics is the foundation of strategy
		-  To some degree it's just because little details matter
			+  All artists know that
			+  Saving a few seconds here or there, avoiding a minor annoyance can make a big psychological difference to your work
		-	But more importantly, you need the intel
			+	You don't know what's going on if you're not in daily contact
				-	I struggle with this all the time...
				-	Artists don't report bugs!	
		-   People don't always see the big strategic savings, but they see the little things.
	*   Arena net story: illustrate how artists are whipped
		+  Artists are very conservative
		+  Vulnerable to stockholm syndome
		+  Example: Arena Net animations
			- Everthing in one file??
			- And if you change something at the beginning, you have to move all subsequent keys????
			- And.... NO ONE COMPLAINED.
		* Segue: Moral of the Anet story:
			- artists don't always stick up for themselves
			- you need to get their trust to make lives better 
			-  So you need to invest in tactics - aka, investing in service - to protect the ability of the strategy side to deliver
		*  Segue: since artists don't stick up for themselves, be proactive
			-  TAs need to spend time with their clients
				+  observing
				+  asking questions
				+  answering questions
				+  helping out
			+  Good tactics boils down:
				-  be friendly
				-  be knowledgeable
				-  be helpful
				-  be responsive
				-  above all, be _there_	
	* Some practical examples
		- Obviously, context specific
		- but here are some examples:
			- Does every crash generate an automatic email?
				- .. and do TA's respond?
			- Are tools released with testing and validation
				- .. or just dumped into a network share?
			- Do TA's know how to help?
				+ there are lots of forms
					+ Good person-to-person skills
					+ Asking good questions
					+ Prioritizing 	
					+ training and education
					+ docs...
			- Do TA's take and implement requests?
	* Segue: time management
		- Good tactics are not something you can just schedule
		- service is a constant drain on attention
		- it's hard to keep focused on big picture items
			+ I tend to rotate people in an out of the hotseat
			+ so there is fast response
			+ and tactical knowledge
		- Key point: don't siloize! 		 	 
	+ Tactics reprise
		* Good tactics is all about service
			- saving #braincells 
			- keeping people happy and productive
		+ The hardest task for TA's is balancing strategy and tactics
			- Strategy, like engineering, tends to take lots of time
			- tension between doing service and complex code
			- TA's need to resist temptation to vanish into the ether
				- constant contact is good for morale
				- constant contact gives TAs better knowledge of the problems
				- constant contact build political capital!
			- Should be as embedded as possible
			- Schedule, plan and work with #strategy and #tactics in mind

>> 27 mins - still too long. Tactics section is flabby.  Need a stronger through-line
>> 

III:  Crisis management
==================================
* Seque:  we've talked about the balance between #strategy and #tactics
 	+ but, to extend the warmongering metaphor, "No plan survives contact the enemy"
	- The other big complicating factor in TA life is the balance between the planned and the unplanned.
	- Good strats will fail. Good service will not magic away production crises
	- Managing  crises is a *critical* part of TA
* production experience is _the_ key
	- can't help what you don't do
	- Good TA needs to be able to switch hit as a production artist
		- not the best, but pro-level
	- Ideally they have "lived the life"
	- You need this for three reasons
		- Can't do good tactics if you don't know the customers
		- Can't do good strategy if you don't know the way things are made
		- In the crises you need to be able to pitch in where needed, business card be damns
* Disaster preparedness
	- The main reason you need experiences is to avoid all the hidden minefields
	- A lot of development is unplanned
	- When things go bad, TA is the first line of defence
		+ time to rename files?
		+ time to track down budget over runs?
		+ time to change contents of hundreds of files?
		+ Call a TA!
* Important difference: Disaster prep vs lurching from one crisis to another  
	- production always involves crises
	- TA's should be there to do the worst cleanup work
	- **BUT** working this way all the time is a failure
		+ It's demoralizing for TAs
		+ It enables bad behavior in other departments
	- Wes G. anecdote
	+ You’ll lose good people if you give them awful work to do
		- true for artists too!
	- Like Normandy beach -sometimes you have to make a frontal assault
		- But if you do it every time you’ll be defeated
		- back reference to #strategy.
* disaster prep tips
	- flexible scheduling
	- open file formats
	- automation tools
	- asset tracking and metadata
* 
IV: Wrap
===========
*	Sum up
	-	TA is a complex role
	-	Short history, no easy models to use
	-	Boils down to a simple idea:
		+	TAs are there to make other people more productive
	-	Getting the most out of TA's
		+	Strategy and tactics
	-	Chaos management
		+	light on your feet
		+	Good drawer full of tools
		+	flexible scheduling	
*  QA

Delenda / notes
============================================================================


- When putting together a department, you need a mix of personalities and skills
* Some examples of different skills with the same title
	- Riggers
		+ subdivided into 'character riggers' and 'technical animators' and 'mocap specialists' and state-machine drivers
	- FX guys
		+ broad range between graphics programmers who write own shaders and particles to production artists
	- 
* Returning to the theme of "fluidity"
	- A good department is a mix of  mix of art and tech skills
		— not just scripters!
			- riggers should animate
			- scripters should use own tools
			- fx / shader wizards need to make art

	-  Getting the most out of your TAD:
		* Wargaming  (DIPLOMACY)
			* Going to engineers with requests gives them all the power to approve or disapprove
			* Going in with a plan lets you set the agenda
			* Get TAD in on the artistic side of the plan, pick technologies that support that
			* Then pad your request list a bit :)
			* There will still be pushback
			* but if you start with a plan, you’re negotiating, not begging.
		* Use your TAs to improve the process  (PROC VISION)
			* constantly look for bullshit
				* what wastes time?
				* what wastes effort?
			* Be on the lookout for stockholm syndrome
				* Arena example
				* Bungie example
				* When artists are too beaten down they don’t even see the pain any more
			* Invest in fixing the process, not bandaids
				* Zipper polygon example
			* Invest in automation, not human wave attacks
				* State of Decay vs Halo
				* Wes anecdote
				* You’ll lose good people if you give them awful work to do
					* true for artists too!
				* There will still alway be situations that need human judgement and eyeballs
					* Like Normandy beach -sometimes you have to make a frontal assault
					* But if you do it every time you’ll be defeated
		* Use your TA's as pioneers (RENAISSANCE MAN)
			- go in early
			- prototype the process
			- push back on engineers
			- validate the practicality
			- then commit the line guys	
		* Expect good service (BUTLER)
			- TA's are there to unblock
			- they need to perfect the art of doing that while not getting bogged down
				— public backlogs
				— good communication
				— effective support
				— fast responses
			- need lots of uptime!
		* Reminder: No human wave attacks!
			- There will be times when somebody has to take one for the team
			- But it that's all they do, you won't keep the smart ones very long
		*
