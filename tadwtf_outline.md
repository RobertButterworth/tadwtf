Hooks
I : What's a TA
===================
* intro / credits
* Aim of the talk:
	- how to get the most out of a department
	- you could be a TAD or an AD, almost the same
* damned if i know!
	- Will Wright hook  ![WW photo]
- Litany of failed metaphors >> Ideally 2 or 3 images per section!
	* MacGuvyer ![MacGuvyer photo]
		- #resourceful
		- TA's love solving problems
			— we are usually self-selected
			— for stubborness and curiosity!
			— Its why we make good debuggers
			— Who ya gonna call?
		- But:
			- he's a loner >> hair jokes
			- we work with others 
	* segue: renaissance man >> ![Leonardo]
		- the "technical"  in technical art makes it sound like it's all engineering
		- Leonardo is a good example of the idea that you can do both
		- ![mona lisa]
			+ We all know he painted the mona lisa
		- ![tech drawing]
			+ But he was also an inventor and tinkerer.
			+ And he was entirely self taught, which is true for most TAs
		- This image works because we're crazy half-and-half hybrids
			+ we can talk to artists and to programmers;  #hybrid
			+ Sometimes, jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none
		- TA's work to bring art and engineering together
		- So, that's a good idea of what a TA does.. 
	* segue: But what about teamwork?   ![RPG image with mage, thief, fighter, cleric]
		- RPG quad
		- Emphasizes teamwork  #service
		- Engineering = Wizard.  The glass cannon
		- Design = Theif.  Leaves work up to everybody else
		- Art = Fighter.  In the trenches
		- TA = Cleric. The support class.
		- Good metaphor! but service means more than spamming heals
			— nobody likes playing as just a buff buddy
	* Segue: service != spamming heals!
		- ![ Downton abbey / Mr Carson] >> perfect image would use almost the same layout as rpg image
		- Service which knows its own domain very well.   #logistics
		- gives deference, but expects to be recognized for expertise
		- the core of that expertise is in logistics and planning
			+ making sure we take on achievable tasks
			+ making it easy to achieve those tasks.
		- is it sexy? not always
		- but it makes the sexy stuff possible	 	 
	* Seque:  I almost wanted to use that as the final image
		- partly because it's funny
		- But I realized, at long last, that I already had the right image
		- it's a T-Shirt you can order from tech-artists.org
		- And that sums it up:
			- TA = "making artists more productive"
			- The most precious resource in any production is creative #brain_cells
			- we make sure they don't get wasted on BS.
	* Summation:
		- TA is a complex role
		- But it has 4 major elements
			— #problem solving
			— #diplomacy
			— #service
			— #logistics / planning
		- next part of the talk is to talk about how to be an informed consumer of TA services.
		- Wrap up on building a good department.
 
 >>  As of "Leonardo 3", coming in at 12 mins.  Not bad.
	
II:  setting expectations
================================
* Segue : Being an informed consumer
	- The key goal of tech art is to make other peoples work easier
	- That's what you want from your TA department
	- This section of the talk is about how to be a good consumer
		+ Doesn't matter who runs the group
		+ or  what the TOE looks like
		+ what matters is how you uses the tech art resources.
	- I want to show you how to be an informed consumer of TA services.
*  #Strategy vs #tactics (PROCESS)  >> Probably needs a wrapup infographic
	- I'm going to divide TA up into two halves
		+ #Strategy
		+ #Tactics
	- you need both!
		- balance shifts over the course of the project
		- more strategy early, more tactics late
		- But both they are mutually reinforcing
		- And equally vital
— Strategy and tactics anecdotes:
	>> let me illustrate what I mean by #strategy
	* Bad example: Zipper level design process
		- it was not a process at all,  it was just the way things happened to get done
		- Hand built levels
		- Important data baked into UVs
		- Roads, blends done by hand.
		- 6-8 week turnaround time for significant changes
		- Compare counterstrike, where we could turn around the level in a day!
		- Bad strategy = Bad process = bad games!
	+ Bad example 2: Bungie lightmaps
		- sometimes the problem is not design or engineering:  
		- sometimes it's artists!
			- all the artists wanted exact control
			- But the reality was a fixed pie
			- Couldn't make them budge
		— result: a huge waste of time, energy, #braincells
			- Results indistinguishable from auto-mapping
			- probably cost $250,000 per year  (10% of c-o-e for 20ish artists & TA support)
			- More importantly, it affected art choices 
				+ less time to think 	
				+ risk aversion
			- There are times when great outcome is worth sacrificing for... but this was not one of them!
	* Good example of #strategy >> Screen shot series, this is probably 4 'slides'
		— State of decay 
			— has 16 square km
			— 40,000 objects placed in the world
			— And parkour-style movement
			— And a team of 20
		— Design wanted to hand-place the markup
			- it's fast and easy
			- we can tweak it!
			- They were thinking "next milestone", ie, tactics
		— I said no
			- I was thinking "next year": strategy
			- the data was unnatural.  What is an oriented line?
			- even if we did it once, we could never manage it
			- and we ended up rebuilding the world 2.5 times
			- We build the markup into the tools
		- End result: we shipped the game, and it more or less worked.
			+ not perfect. Some assets could not be reused
			+ needed work from art, TA and engineering
			+ But it made the game shippable w/ tiny team
			+ low cost in #brain_cells
		- #Strategy saves the day
	
— Strategy reprise:
	* Moral of all 3 stories:
		- picking the right battles is the key to a successful production
		- you need good strategy to preserve #braincells
		- Not everything can be highest quality
		- Not everything can be hand tweaked to a high gloss
		- Every artists knows this while working
			- do don't forget it when thinking about how the production is designed
		-  You should expect... no, demand! -- good strategic insights from your TAD 	
	* Side note: Strategy and organization
		-  Is TA a department or group?
		-  Personally I don't much care
			-  if you're in a situation where TOE is important, you're probably already in trouble
		-  However, heres one useful principle to keep in mind
			- You want the TAD in discussions where process is important!
				- new features
				- new workflows
				- scalability
			-  The key thing that matter is **making the team pay attention to artists time and how it is spent.**
			-  It it takes a title to do that, then great 	
	*  Segue: We haven't said much about tactics
		-  When I say tactics, you should hear "help" or "service"  #cleric
		-   tactics matters
			+  small improvements are the core of the bond between TA and Art
			+  show that problems are understood
			+  and artist time is valued
	* Tactics is the foundation of strategy
		- The reason the industry moved away from tools programmers and towards TAS is that TA have lived the life
			+ they know the needs
			+ they know the frustrations
			+ >> graphic? Maybe a pyramid with artist on top, TAs in the middle, tools programmers in the base?
			+ This is why it's so important that the TA department has production experience.
		-   People don't always see the big strategic savings, but they see the little things.
			+  Artists are very conservative
			+  Vulnerable to stockholm syndome
			+  Example: Arena Net animations
				- Everthing in one file??
				- And if you change something at the beginning, you have to move all subsequent keys????
				- And.... NO ONE COMPLAINED.
		* Moral of the Anet story:
			- artists don't always stick up for themselves
			- you need to get their trust to make lives better 
			-  So you need to invest in tactics - aka, investing in service - to protect the ability of the strategy side to deliver
		*  Good tactics is really simple:
			-  be friendly
			-  be knowledgeable
			-  be helpful
			-  be responsive
			-  You need to make sure your TA's do and don't retreat into their own little world.  Daily contacts are important!
	
	* So, how can you evaluate the tactics of your TA's?
		- Obviously, context specific
		- but here are some examples:
			- Does every crash generate an automatic email?
				- .. and do TA's respond?
			- Are tools released with testing and validation
				- .. or just dumped into a network share?
			- Do TA's know how to help?
				+ there are lots of forms
					+ Good person-to-person skills
					+ Asking good questions
					+ Prioritizing 
			- Do the TA's keep artists happy and productive
	+ Tactics reprise
		* Good tactics is all about service
			- saving #braincells 
			- keeping people happy and productive
		* The hardest task for TA's is balancing strategy and tactics
			- Strategy, like engineering, tends to take lots of time
			- tension between doing service and complex code
			- TA's need to resist temptation to vanish into the ether
				- constant contact is good for morale
				- constant contact gives TAs better knowledge of the problems
				- constant contact build political capital!
			- Should be as embedded as possible
			- Schedule, plan and work with #strategy and #tactics in mind
	 	 	  
III:  Crisis management
==================================
* Seque:  we've talked about the balance between #strategy and #tactics
	- The other big complicating factor in TA life is the balance between the planned and the unplanned.
	- As napoleon used to say, "No plan survives contact the enemy"
	- Good strats will fail. Good service will not magic away production crises
	- Surviving crises is a key part of TA
* production experience is _the_ key
	- can't help what you don't do
	- Good TA needs to be able to switch hit as a production artist
		- not the best, but pro-level
	- Ideally they have "lived the life"
	- You need this for two reasons
		- Can't do good tactics if you don't know the customers
		- Can't do good strategy if you don't know the way things are made
* Disaster preparedness
	- The main reason you need experiences is to avoid all the hidden minefields
	- A lot of development is unplanned
	- When things go bad, TA is the first line of defence
		+ time to rename files?
		+ time to track down budget over runs?
		+ time to change contents of hundreds of files?
		+ Call a TA!
* Important difference: Disaster prep vs lurching from one crisis to another  
	- production always involves crises
	- TA's should be there to do the worst cleanup work
	- **BUT** working this way all the time is a failure
		+ It's demoralizing for TAs
		+ It enables bad behavior in other departments
	- Wes G. anecdote
	+ You’ll lose good people if you give them awful work to do
		- true for artists too!
	- Like Normandy beach -sometimes you have to make a frontal assault
		- But if you do it every time you’ll be defeated
		- back reference to #strategy.
* disaster prep tips
	- flexible scheduling
	- open file formats
	- automation tools
	- asset tracking and metadata
	-
IV: Wrap
===========
*	Sum up
	-	TA is a complex role
	-	Short history, no easy models to use
	-	Boils down to a simple idea:
		+	TAs are there to make other people more productive
	-	Getting the most out of TA's
		+	Strategy and tactics
	-	Chaos management
		+	light on your feet
		+	Good drawer full of tools
		+	flexible scheduling	
*  QA
