Part I: What's a TA? 
========
^ I started this talk as a discussion of my job
	- but that's not too interesting to this audience
	- instead
		- how to get the most out of a department
	- TA is a new field
		- 2006 article
		- 2009 trip
	- now recognized - but often mis-used
	- So this talk is about
		- Overview of what TA is for
		- How to be a good consumer of TA services
		- Keeping your TA department in shape

^ so, I did what I'm sure somebody in this room does and tried to google up some pictures I could use to illustrate the idea
^ This a tricky job because it's hard to describe what we do.

^ he's resourceful
	- TA's love solving problems
		— we are usually self-selected
		— for stubborness and curiosity!

^  we specialize in improvisation and making do with what we can.

---
> graphic: another mcguyver, being very scientific

^ MacG is a scientist, he likes to get to the bottom of things. so do we.
^ Its why we make good debuggers

---
What's a TA?
============

-  An improviser

^ segue: but macg is a primarily a technical person; that misses an important part of who we are. We're not just techie, we're also artists

---
![Leonardo](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/anthonykosner/files/2013/08/leonardo-da-vinci-06.jpg)

	- Leonardo is proof idea that you can be technical and creative

---
![](http://www.leonardodavincisinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/leonardo-da-vinci-helicopter.jpg)

^ But he was also an inventor and tinkerer.
 And he was entirely self taught, which is true for most TAs
	- This image works because we're crazy half-and-half hybrids
		+ we can talk to artists and to programmers;  #hybrid
		+ Sometimes, jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none

---
![](pic: school of athens?)

^ now this is not a leonardo butit's a renaissance classic; its about putting two worlds together.  Plato contemplates the divine and aristotle the earthly.
^ We do that too: bringing different worlds together
	+ because we speak both languages, we are often the negotiators or diplomats 

---
What's a TA?
============
-  An improviser
-  A tech / art hybrid

^ segue: But what about teamwork?   
^ as hybrids, you could say we're dual-classed

---

![fill](http://foolproofdesigns.com/videogamejerks/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DND_TOD_Characters.png)

^	- RPG quad
	- Emphasizes teamwork  #service
	- Engineering = Wizard.  The glass cannon
	- Design = Theif.  Leaves work up to everybody else
	- Art = Fighter.  In the trenches
	- TA = Cleric. The support class.

---

> need better graphic here

^ what makes TA's happy is keeping everybody at max health; adding buffs, spamming heals, and raising the dead - or at least, recovering lost files.  We're here to keep you in the fight

---

What's a TA?
============
-  An improviser
-  A tech / art hybrid
-  A support specialist

^ improvisation and border crossing define the way we work - but providing those buffs defines *what* we do

---

![](http://cdn9.staztic.com/app/a/5108/5108528/healing-simulator-rpg-1-1-s-307x512.jpg)

^  a Good metaphor! but service means more than spamming heals
		— nobody likes playing as just a buff buddy

---

![](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/130/2/c/downton_abbey___promotional_poster_by_emreunayli-d4z89pw.jpg)

^ This is an interesting metaphor
	- Service which knows its own domain very well.   #logistics
	- gives deference, but expects to be recognized for expertise
	
---

![](http://www.comediva.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/downton-party_whenevs.jpg)

^ There is a lot of special expertise on both sides that's needed to make things come off
^ lady cora knows who can't sit with who
^ but she doesn't know where the silverwear is, or how many pounds of potatoes you need to feed twenty guests
^ the folks downstairs are not as glamorous as the lords and ladies but they have essential skills and knowledge


---

![](http://taylorholmes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/downtonabbey-servants.jpg)

^ Game production is of course even more complex and has more specialist knowledge
^ There are a lot of issues in production which are not art - you can't make art without resolving those issues
^ This is a critical part of what TA's do: the try to makes sure the party goes well for the artists 	 
	
---

![](http://media.nj.com/indulge/photo/downton-abbey-series-3-31e53281a83d2a49.jpg)

^ you could do worse as a metaphor than the relationship between upstairs and downstairs as a way of describing how art and techart relate....
^ the best service uses the talent and creativity of the both sides


---
What's a TA?
============

-  An improviser
-  A tech / art hybrid
-  A support specialist
-  A logistics wizard

^ Segue:  I almost wanted to use that as the final image
	- partly because it's funny
	- But I realized, at long last, that I already had the right image
	- it's a T-Shirt you can order from tech-artists.org
	- And that sums it up:
		- TA = "making artists more productive"
		- The most precious resource in any production is creative #brain_cells
		- we make sure they don't get wasted on BS.

---
What's a TA?
============

-  An improviser
-  A tech / art hybrid
-  A support specialist
-  A logistics wizard
-  Fights for the users

^ So what do we do? This is all of it. 
^ dhunt note : don't make this oppositional

> replace the charlie brown image with something about distraction
![fit](http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1688698.jpg)

^ segue: But let me make that concrete 
- we all know that parts of our jobs are garbage
	- come in, 3 hours of emails, meetings, personnel conflicts...
	- you're not in the mood to make great art
	- finite reserve of decisions
	- don't waste them

^ It's why obama, steve jobs, etc...
^ Creative thinking is a precious, finite resource
^ finite resources

---
> ![]() sublime text screenshot
^ creative people work very hard to create distraction free environments

^ this is why we so many writers like distration free writing software instead of fancy word processors


---
> !()[] nasty ui dialog box screen shot
^ But we give our artists tools that look like this. This is the opposite of distraction free!
^ The difference between a TA and and a working artist could be summarized like this:
^ Artist sees this and says, "ok, what do I have to do to meet my deadlines"
^ TA sees this and says "this is ridiculous, we have to fix it"

---
> Creative decisions are a **finite** resource. 
Don't waste them on crap.

^ If you don't remember anything else I say today, remember this.
^ and remember that TA's are here to help save you from wasting creativity on crap.


---
Part II: TA lifecycle
=====================
^ TAs are there to fight that fight on your behalf
	- to make smart workflows
	- to keep people focused on creative tasks
^ That fight is the hear of evererything we do.
^ Segue: for the rest of the talk I'll walk through the dev cycle..


---
Project lifecycle
=====================
- Preproduction
- Buildout
- Production
- Wrap

> graphic: stopwatch? 4 settings

^ Segue: for the rest of the talk I'll walk through the dev cycle..
	- Preproduction
	- Buildout
	- Production
	- Ship
	- I'd like to walk you through the way that TA's deal with these cycle, and how our role changes.
	- It's important to see that what we we do changes a lot over the course of the production
	- understanding that is key to making good use of what we offer.

---
> Graphic: build on previous slide
Project lifecycle
====================
- Pre-production: Planning 
- Buildout: Building tools
- Production: Help and training
- Wrapup: Crisis management

^I'm going to show you how the things the TAs do map onto these four big cycles. 
^ In part this is to show you the breadth of what we do
^ In part to help you see that a good TA org has to move with the times

---
Preproduction
=============

![](http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-14-at-1.15.12-PM.png)

^ lots of agendas going on
^ segue: this is the time of maximum uncertanty. But the best remedy for uncertainty is not argument in a vacuum, it's prototyping


---
![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZvpdTNsZew/TtIpZQ0Pn2I/AAAAAAAABfA/nvv35ECqZJI/s400/01_P_MacchineGoldberg.jpg)


^ Tas love prototypig
	- our inner macgyver
	- Naya FPS story

^ segue: Ta's love prototyping
^ ...but not all arguments are prototypable

---
![](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/233/0/7/arm_wrestling_by_whifi-d47cigx.png)

	
^ A lot of the prepro process is about figuring out how the game will make be made
^	- preprois tough for many artists
		- bad pattern
		- engineer bullying
		- TA's stand up more
		- ta's = stronger negotiators
	- Ben W Story
	- Leonardo side

^ segue:  once all the negotiations are done, we also have to design the tools that will implement all those workflow ideas
^ Here's another way that TAs come in handy
^ if you leave this stuff to pure tech people, you get things like this...

---
![](https://smarties2013.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bad-userinterface1.jpg)

^ TAs are good at worfklow design
	-  They have production know-how 
		+  eating your own dogfood is good
			- TAs do; tools programmers usually don't
	-  They've usually seen the results of mistakes close up!
		+  bad decisions often land in our laps
		+  We know the hard truth:
			- no handshake agreement lasts
			- everything is iterative
			- yesterday's stretch goal is tomorrow's front line feature

---
TA in preproduction
=====================
- Prototyping
- Negotiating
- Workflow design

^ So this is what you are looking for in pre-production:
^ TA's are looking out for the way the game is going to be made
^ both features and ways of working
^ this is the where the combo of art and science becomes important
	- Dhunt story

---
![fit](http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/keep-calm-and-iterate-11.png)

^ If your artists 	
	- experiment and iterate,
	- not afraid to try new things
	- are able to work together...
^ then you've done your job

---
Good pre-production makes good workflows
=====
- Transparent
- Efficient
- Collaborative
- Iterative

^ As customers it may be hard for you to evaluate prepro at the time
^ it's hard to calculate the cost of disasters avoided
^ But you can see if the plans laid in this period are the source of the tools and processes you use later
^ you can judge them by their fruits


---

> Graphic: The Dictator

Side note: TA organization
==============================
- Titles don't matter much
- But TA needs a seat at the table


^	-  Is TA a department or group?
	-  Personally I don't much care
		-  if you're in a situation where TOE is important, you're probably already in trouble
	-  However, heres one useful principle to keep in mind
		- You want the TAD in discussions where process is important!
			- new features
			- new workflows
			- scalability
		-  The key thing that matter is **making the team pay attention to artists time and how it is spent.**
		-  It it takes a title to do that, then great 
^ needs graphic? Repeat the ponies?

---
Early Production
===
![](http://overwaterunderfire.org/mobile/img/LANDGRAB_images/landgrabHoover.jpg)

^ this section could all be construction themed

^	- moving from pre-pro to production
		- things get real
		- time to redeem the promises
	- take of the negotiator hat, put on the programmer hat

---
> Graphic. Some kind of engineering fail. ideally social-realist

^	- this is stressful time for us
		- 	we have to deliver, people are waiting
		- we have to do it fast
		- we have to do it reliably

---
> graphic: Spiderman? Great power, great responsibility
^	- Ta's have not always done this
		- when we got started 10 -15 years ago this was pretty haphazeard
		- nowadays it's a critical path for the whole compnay
		- with great power comes great responsibility
		- Haywood's text editor
			- moral: can't be too safe

---
Not just good tools!
==========
- Good Implementation
- Smooth Releases
- Fast fixes

^ you may not be able to evaluate the programming of your TAs
^ but you're in a great position to evaluate the rollouts:
		- smooth delivery
		- fast fixes
		- tested, bulletproofed
		- trust	
		- TA's aren't always good at that

---
Rollouts
================
- Planned
- Not disruptive
- Quick shakeout

^ Trust themes: what you should be looking for is 
^ nondisruptive releases
^ well tested and basically functional
^ Glitches addressed quickly

---
>GRAPHIC: trust

^ all of this boils down to trust
^ Do the TA's provide tools that artists trust
^ and maintain them
^ and improve them
^ trust is the foundation of buy-in 

---
Production
===========

![](http://i.imgur.com/BRh4S.jpg)

^ seque: building trust critical in this next phase of production 

---
> Graphic, relaxation

^ for us this is a more relaxing time, but also really important 
^ This the good time, when the team is really running along
^ new stuff happening, getting in game
^ artists are perfecting new techniques

----
>  Graphic, service with a smile


^ this is when the service side of TA really comes into the fore
^ for example, automatic error reporting
^ fast turnarounds on fixes

---
> Graphic: zombie error dialog

^ Service means attention to detail
	* like making sure that every error is being logged and reported
	* artists never report bugs voluntarily
	* but if every error generates an email - and a visit from the TA... that builds trust


---
> graphic: TA backlog

^ seque: not every bug can be handled directly
^ not every suggestion can be acted on right away
^ releases that don't mess with schedules
^ new feature requests being handled; backlog

---

> graphic: Relationship theme

^ Segue: but all this is technical.  The real key to service is relationships.
^ prodution is the time when we should be building relationships.
expect tas' to be out there with the artists
^ demoing, explaining
^ pushing feedback to engineers
^ this is self interest:
	- better educated artists are better for us
	- time spent with users makes us better at what we do


---
> Graphic, learned helplessness


^ Anet story


----
![](http://th07.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2012/224/2/9/michelangelo__heavy_and_medic_by_fustang-d5avrv0.png)

^ segue: we need to build those relationships so we know wha'ts going on
^ this is where wee really build the relationships that let us know how to do our jobs right
^ we need to be communicating well so we can learn from the artists
^ and stand up for them in other phases of the project

----
TA Service Guide
==========
- Approachable
- Responsive
- Embedded 

^ Good service  boils down to relationships:
	-  be friendly
	-  be knowledgeable
	-  be helpful
	-  be responsive
	-  above all, be _there_
	- >> keep the joke about "if being a grouchy genius is needed, we have programmers for that"	

---
TA in Late production
===============
- It's all working

^  	big questions answered, big tools delivered

__
![]()
> Graphic: some kind of not too serious disaster relief pictue

^	- now is when shit hits the fan
		- all the guesses made in the dark get tested
		- many will be wrong
		- "rebuild all the physics message"
		- "quantize all the vertex colors"
		- "cnahge all of these p's to q's"

---
> Graphic: first responders


^ TA is the first line of defence when things go wrong
		- it comes with the territory
		-but there are good ways and bad ways
^ We have good skills for dealing with emergencies
	- debugging
		- more stubborn and more inclined to pick at clues
	- technical background
		- "we can spot a convex hull"
	- ad-hoc automation
		- Undead tree Story

---
> Graphic sucks to be us

^ from a management and personal standpoint, it still sucks
	 by definition, it's not planned
	- hard to improve, because every crisis is different
	- high time costs
	- unpredictable
^ Still, it comes with the territory
^ it's a key part of what we do
^ however... there are right ways and wrong ways to deal

---
> Graphic: Elephant and broom


^ It's good to know that TAs are there to help out in emergencies
^ that doesn't mean you can embrace bad tools and bad worfklows
^ and trust us to pick up the pieces
	- value the heroics
	- don't take them granted
	- gruntwork saps morale

^	- wes g story
		- don't be a garbageman	


___
> Graphic "no garbagemen"

^  too many companies choose the bad way
			- human wave attacks
			- drudgery
			- keeping people tasked out 100%
		- if you waste artists time on crap, you're doing it wrong
^		- if you waste all TA time on crap, you're also doing it wrong!
	- sometimes you have to do it anyway
	- but it's a mistake


---
TA Disaster preparedness
==================
+ automation
+ open file formats
+ asset tracking
+ Defensive development

^ What can yoyu do to help?
^ Good preparation helps a lot
^ Key weapons are
	+ good tools
	+ open file formats
	+ asset tracking
	+ Cynicism
		- "We just wont do that" rarely works
		-  when it does, it's not always a good thing
	+ Don't overschedule

---
Wrapup

The TA production lifecyle
=======================
- Balance shifts over time
- Good department is balanced
	- Tech
	- Relationships
	- Emergency services	


^  get the balance right
	- don't overdo tech
		- no ivory tower
	- don't overdo service
		- ta's must be innovating
	- don't overdo human waves.
