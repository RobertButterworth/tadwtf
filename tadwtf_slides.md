Part I: What's a TA? 
========
^ I started this talk as a discussion of my job
	- but that's not too interesting to this audience
	- instead
		- how to get the most out of a department
	- TA is a new field
		- 2006 article
		- 2009 trip
	- now recognized - but often mis-used
	- So this talk is about
		- Overview of what TA is for
		- How to be a good consumer of TA services
		- Keeping your TA department in shape

^ he's resourceful
	- TA's love solving problems
		— we are usually self-selected
		— for stubborness and curiosity!

![Leonardo](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/anthonykosner/files/2013/08/leonardo-da-vinci-06.jpg)

^	- the "technical"  in technical art makes it sound like it's all engineering
	- Leonardo is proof idea that you can be technical and creative

^ But he was also an inventor and tinkerer.
 And he was entirely self taught, which is true for most TAs
	- This image works because we're crazy half-and-half hybrids
		+ we can talk to artists and to programmers;  #hybrid
		+ Sometimes, jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none
	- TA's work to bring art and engineering together
		+ because we speak both languages, we are often the negotiators or diplomats

^ segue: But what about teamwork?   
	- RPG quad
	- Emphasizes teamwork  #service
	- Engineering = Wizard.  The glass cannon
	- Design = Theif.  Leaves work up to everybody else
	- Art = Fighter.  In the trenches
	- TA = Cleric. The support class.

^ what makes TA's happy is keeping everybody at max health; adding buffs, spamming heals, and raising the dead - or at least, recovering lost files.  We're here to keep you in the fight

^ Segue: service != spamming heals!
	- Service which knows its own domain very well.   #logistics
	- gives deference, but expects to be recognized for expertise

^ a black tie dinner for doesn't just happen!
^ somebody's got to check the inventory...
^ the core of that expertise is in logistics and planning
		+ making sure we take on achievable tasks
		+ making it easy to achieve those tasks.

^ Segue:  I almost wanted to use that as the final image
	- partly because it's funny
	- But I realized, at long last, that I already had the right image
	- it's a T-Shirt you can order from tech-artists.org
	- And that sums it up:
		- TA = "making artists more productive"
		- The most precious resource in any production is creative #brain_cells
		- we make sure they don't get wasted on BS.

^ segue: let me make that concrete 
- we all know that parts of our jobs are garbage
	- come in, 3 hours of emails, meetings, personnel conflicts...
	- you're not in the mood to make great art
	- finite reserve of decisions
	- don't waste them

----

![fit](http://www.womanology.co.uk/folder/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Charlie4.jpg)

^ that's important, because the industry often does not remember this
	- we ask for a lot of technical gibberish
	- a lot of process chaos
	- not good for creativity

---
Save the brain cells
====================
- Better planning
- Better tools
- Help and training
- Crisis management

^ TAs are there to fight that fight on your behalf
	- to make smart workflows
	- to keep people focused on creative tasks
- That fight is the hear of evererything we do.

----
> Creativity is a precious resource. Don't waste it on crap.

^ If you don't take anything else away from this talk, Remember that


---
Project lifecycle
=====================
- Preproduction
- Buildout
- Production
- Ship

^ Segue: for the rest of the talk I'll walk through the dev cycle..
	- Preproduction
	- Buildout
	- Production
	- Ship
	- I'd like to walk you through the way that TA's deal with these cycle, and how our role changes.

----
Project lifecycle
=====================
- Daydreams
- Optimism
- Blithe Ignorance
- Disaster

^ However we also know that the neat little model of development rarely works out as planned.  My cynical little bullets here are a bit too much, but it points out something important about making games: you make all the decisions at the beginning, in the dark. You only find out later which guesses you know about.

---
TA in preproduction
=======================
- Prototyping

^ so let's look at how TA's do this over the life of the project
	- prepro is good for TAs
		- everything is up in the air
		- lots of questions to answer
		- lots of boundaries to push
	
---
TA in preproduction
=======================
- Prototyping
- Negotiating

^	- preprois tough for many artists
		- bad pattern
		- engineer bullying
		- TA's stand up more
		- ta's = stronger negotiators
	- Ben W Story
		- you need to negotiate
		- 4 % not worth the hassle

---
TA in preproduction
=====================
- Prototyping
- Negotiating
- Workflow design

^ TAs are good at worfklow design
	-  They have production know-how 
		+  eating your own dogfood is good
			- TAs do; tools programmers usually don't
	-  They've usually seen the results of mistakes close up!
		+  bad decisions often land in our laps
		+  We know the hard truth:
			- no handshake agreement lasts
			- everything is iterative
			- yesterday's stretch goal is tomorrow's front line feature


---
Good workflow design
===================
- Transparent

^ 	-  Are understandable!	
		-  TAs can help more, if they contribute more
		-  That's why I like this kind of exporter dialog ![1 button exporter dialog image]
		-  instead of this ![typical Fbx with all options visible]

---
Good workflow design
===================
- Transparent
- Efficient

^	-  instead of this ![typical Fbx with all options visible]
	-  Are efficient
		+  One button and go is good
		+ But there are many other ways to make things efficient
			+  automatic naming and file placement
			+  visual browsers with tagging instead of folder hierarchies
			+  Search and replace in data files

---
Good workflow design
===================
- Transparent
- Efficient
- Collaborative

^ encourage sharing
	- eg, asser browser
^ encourage working together
	- eg, no shared photoshop file
	- hard to screw each other

---
Good workflow design
===================
- Transparent
- Efficient
- Collaborative
- Iterative

^ artists want to experiment and iterate


---
Side note: TA organization
==============================
- Titles don't matter much
- But TA needs a seat at the table


^	-  Is TA a department or group?
	-  Personally I don't much care
		-  if you're in a situation where TOE is important, you're probably already in trouble
	-  However, heres one useful principle to keep in mind
		- You want the TAD in discussions where process is important!
			- new features
			- new workflows
			- scalability
		-  The key thing that matter is **making the team pay attention to artists time and how it is spent.**
		-  It it takes a title to do that, then great 
^ needs graphic

---	
TA in Early Production
==============
- Implementation

^	- moving from pre-pro to production
		- things get real
		- time to redeem the promises
	- take of the negotiator hat, put on the programmer hat
	- this is stressful time for us
		- 	we have to deliver, people are waiting
		- we have to do it fast
		- we have to do it reliably

---
TA in Early Production
==============
- Implementation
- Releases

^	- Ta's have not always done this
		- when we got started 10 -15 years ago this was pretty haphazeard
		- nowadays it's a critical path for the whole compnay
		- with great power comes great responsibility
		- Haywood's text editor
			- moral: can't be too safe

---
TA in Early Production
==========
- Implementation
- Releases
- Fast fixes

^ Expect good service
		- smooth delivery
		- fast fixes
		- tested, bulletproofed
		- trust	
		- TA's aren't always good at that

---
Good TA Rollouts
================
- Planned
- Not disruptive
- Quick shakeout

^ Trust themes: what you should be looking for is 
^ safe, gentle, nondisruptive releases
^ that are tested and work out of the box

---
TA in Mid-project
============
- Stable tools

^ for us this is a more relaxing time, but also really important 
^ This the good time, when the team is really running along
^ new stuff happening, getting in game
^ artists are perfecting new techniques

----
TA in Mid-project
============
- Stable tools
- Good uptime

^ this is when you should also see how well your TAs do at maintenance
^ for example, automatic error reporting
^ fast turnarounds on fixes
^ releases that don't mess with schedules
^ new feature requests being handled; backlog

---
TA in Mid-project
============
- Stable tools
- Good uptime
- Education

^ A very important part of this period is education and training
^ expect tas' to be out there with the artists
^ demoing, explaining
^ pushing feedback to engineers

---
TA in Mid-project
============
- Stable tools
- Small fixes
- Education
- Relationship building

^ -build relationships
	- see how we're doing
	- Good for our tech sides
	- but more important for other side
	- ANet story goes here

----
Good TA Service
==========
- Approachable
- Responsive
- Embedded 

^ Good service  boils down to relationships:
	-  be friendly
	-  be knowledgeable
	-  be helpful
	-  be responsive
	-  above all, be _there_
	- >> keep the joke about "if being a grouchy genius is needed, we have programmers for that"	

---
TA in Late production
===============
- It's all working

^  	big questions answered, big tools delivered

---
TA in Late production
===============
- It's all working
- Until disaster hits

^	- now is when shit hits the fan
		- all the guesses made in the dark get tested
		- many will be wrong
		- "rebuild all the physics message"
		- "quantize all the vertex colors"
		- "cnahge all of these p's to q's"

---
TA Disaster response
===================
- TA's are 'first responders' 
- Tech skills
- Automation

^	- this hits Ta's hardest
		- it comes with the territory
		-but there are good ways and bad ways
	 by definition, it's not planned
	- hard to improve, because every crisis is different
	- high time costs
	- unpredictable

---
Low investment trap
===============
- value the heroics
- don't take them granted
- gruntwork saps morale

^  too many companies choose the bad way
			- human wave attacks
			- drudgery
			- keeping people tasked out 100%
		- if you waste artists time on crap, you're doing it wrong
		- if you waste all TA time on crap, you're also doing it wrong!
	- right way:
		- good tools to minimize these crises
		- up fron investsments to make us more flexible
		- TA's who use automation
		- learn from mistakes
	- sometimes you have to do it anyway
	- but it's a mistake
	- wes g story
		- don't be a garbageman	

---
TA Disaster preparedness
==================
+ automation
+ open file formats
+ asset tracking
+ Defensive development

^ Key weapons are
	+ good tools
	+ automation 
	+ open file formats
	+ asset tracking
	+ Cynicism
		- "We just wont do that" rarely works
		-  when it does, it's not always a good thing


The TA production lifecyle
=======================
- Balance shifts over time
- Good department is balanced
	- Tech
	- Relationships
	- Emergency services	


^  get the balance right
	- don't overdo tech
		- no ivory tower
	- don't overdo service
		- ta's must be innovating
	- don't overdo human waves.

^ redo the graphic with the right heads

^ There's an infinity of details that I can't cover here, but all TAs work falls into one of r big categories 
^ tools = leonardo
^ pipelines = mr carson
^ support = the medic
^ emergencies = macgyver

--- 
What for?
========
- this all boills down to one basic job:
	- saving braincells

---

![Steve jobs closet](http://allaboutstevejobs.com/persona/steveathome/05.jpg)

^ Creative thinking is a precious, finite resource
	+ don't waste it on BS stuff
	+ Focus on story, moood, character
	+ Not on file names, check boxes
	- All boil down to one big thing:
	+ Making artists more productive

---
> Creative decisions are a **finite** resource. 
Don't waste them on crap.
