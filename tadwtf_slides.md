Part I: What's a TA? 
========
^ I started this talk as a discussion of my job
	- but that's not too interesting to this audience
	- instead
		- how to get the most out of a department
	- TA is a new field
		- 2006 article
		- 2009 trip
	- now recognized - but often mis-used
	- So this talk is about
		- Overview of what TA is for
		- How to be a good consumer of TA services
		- Keeping your TA department in shape

^ But he was also an inventor and tinkerer.
 And he was entirely self taught, which is true for most TAs
	- This image works because we're crazy half-and-half hybrids
		+ we can talk to artists and to programmers;  #hybrid
		+ Sometimes, jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none
	- TA's work to bring art and engineering together
		+ because we speak both languages, we are often the negotiators or diplomats

^ segue: But what about teamwork?   
	- RPG quad
	- Emphasizes teamwork  #service
	- Engineering = Wizard.  The glass cannon
	- Design = Theif.  Leaves work up to everybody else
	- Art = Fighter.  In the trenches
	- TA = Cleric. The support class.

^ Segue: service != spamming heals!
	- Service which knows its own domain very well.   #logistics
	- gives deference, but expects to be recognized for expertise

^ a black tie dinner for doesn't just happen!
^ somebody's got to check the inventory...
^ the core of that expertise is in logistics and planning
		+ making sure we take on achievable tasks
		+ making it easy to achieve those tasks.

	- partly because it's funny
	- But I realized, at long last, that I already had the right image
	- it's a T-Shirt you can order from tech-artists.org
	- And that sums it up:
		- TA = "making artists more productive"
		- The most precious resource in any production is creative #brain_cells
		- we make sure they don't get wasted on BS.

What's a TA?
============

-  An improviser
-  A tech / art hybrid
-  A support specialist
-  A logistics wizard
-  Fights for the users


---
Fight for the users....
==========================
![](http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1688698.jpg)
^ segue: let me make that concrete 
- we all know that parts of our jobs are garbage
	- come in, 3 hours of emails, meetings, personnel conflicts...
	- you're not in the mood to make great art
	- finite reserve of decisions
	- don't waste them

---
Aaaugh!
=======
- Development is hard
- Art is harder
- Both together is rough

----

![](http://www.womanology.co.uk/folder/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Charlie4.jpg)
^ that's important, because the industry often does not remember this
	- we ask for a lot of technical gibberish
	- a lot of process chaos
	- not good for creativity

---
Save the brain cells
====================
- Better planning
- Better tools
- Help and training
- Crisis management

^ TAs are there to fight that fight on your behalf
	- to make smart workflows
	- to keep people focused on creative tasks
- That fight is the hear of evererything we do.

----
> Creativity is a precious resource. Don't waste it on crap.

^ If you don't take anything else away from this talk, Remember that

---
Project lifecycle
=====================
- Preproduction
- Implementation
- Production
- Ship

^ we're all familiar with the traditional development cycle...
	- Preproduction
	- Implementation
	- Production
	- Ship
	- I'd like to walk you through the way that TA's deal with these cycle, and how our role changes.
----
Project lifecycle
=====================
- Daydreams
- Optimism
- Blithe Ignorance
- Disaster

^ However we also know that the neat little model of development rarely works out as planned.  My cynical little bullets here are a bit too much, but it points out something important about making games: you make all the decisions at the beginning, in the dark. You only find out later which guesses you know about.

---
TA in preproduction
=======================
- Prototyping

^ so let's look at how TA's do this over the life of the project
	- prepro is good for TAs
		- everything is up in the air
		- lots of questions to answer
		- lots of boundaries to push
	
---
TA in preproduction
=======================
- Prototyping
- Negotiating

^	- preprois tough for many artists
		- bad pattern
		- engineer bullying
		- TA's stand up more
		- ta's = stronger negotiators
	- Ben W Story
		- you need to negotiate
		- 4 % not worth the hassle

---
TA in preproduction
=====================
- Prototyping
- Negotiating
- Workflow design

^ TAs are good at worfklow design
	-  They have production know-how 
		+  eating your own dogfood is good
			- TAs do; tools programmers usually don't
	-  They've usually seen the results of mistakes close up!
		+  bad decisions often land in our laps
		+  We know the hard truth:
			- no handshake agreement lasts
			- everything is iterative
			- yesterday's stretch goal is tomorrow's front line feature



---
Good workflow design
===================
- Transparent
- Efficient
- Collaborative
- Iterative

^ Prero is not just the time when you hammer out the story and schedule
 - it's when you figure out how to make the game
 - matching tools to task is critical
 - mistakes here have big consequences
 - TA"s are critical here, because we know the costs of poor designs
 - EG, bungie character process
^  Strategy has many details, but Good strategies...
	-  Are understandable!	
		-  TAs can help more, if they contribute more
		-  That's why I like this kind of exporter dialog ![1 button exporter dialog image]
		-  instead of this ![typical Fbx with all options visible]
	-  Are efficient
		+  One button and go is good
		+ But there are many other ways to make things efficient
			+  automatic naming and file placement
			+  visual browsers with tagging instead of folder hierarchies
			+  Search and replace in data files
	-  Are collaborative and iterative
		+  CTRL+G is good !

---
TA organization
==============================
- Titles don't matter much
- But TA needs a seat at the table


^	-  Is TA a department or group?
	-  Personally I don't much care
		-  if you're in a situation where TOE is important, you're probably already in trouble
	-  However, heres one useful principle to keep in mind
		- You want the TAD in discussions where process is important!
			- new features
			- new workflows
			- scalability
		-  The key thing that matter is **making the team pay attention to artists time and how it is spent.**
		-  It it takes a title to do that, then great 
^ needs graphic

---	
TA in Early Production
==============
- Implementation

^	- moving from pre-pro to production
		- things get real
		- time to redeem the promises
	- take of the negotiator hat, put on the programmer hat
	- this is stressful time for us
		- 	we have to deliver, people are waiting
		- we have to do it fast
		- we have to do it reliably

---
TA in Early Production
==============
- Implementation
- Releases

^	- Ta's have not always done this
		- when we got started 10 -15 years ago this was pretty haphazeard
		- nowadays it's a critical path for the whole compnay
		- with great power comes great responsibility
		- Haywood's text editor
			- moral: can't be too safe

---
TA in Early Production
==========
- Implementation
- Releases
- Fast fixes

^ Expect good service
		- smooth delivery
		- fast fixes
		- tested, bulletproofed
		- trust	
		- TA's aren't always good at that

---
Good TA Rollouts
================
- Planned
- Not disruptive
- Quick shakeout

^ Trust themes: what you should be looking for is 
^ safe, gentle, nondisruptive releases
^ that are tested and work out of the box

---
TA in Mid-project
============
- Stable tools

^ for us this is a more relaxing time, but also really important 
^ This the good time, when the team is really running along
^ new stuff happening, getting in game
^ artists are perfecting new techniques

----
TA in Mid-project
============
- Stable tools
- Good uptime

^ this is when you should also see how well your TAs do at maintenance
^ for example, automatic error reporting
^ fast turnarounds on fixes
^ releases that don't mess with schedules
^ new feature requests being handled; backlog

---
TA in Mid-project
============
- Stable tools
- Good uptime
- Education

^ A very important part of this period is education and training
^ expect tas' to be out there with the artists
^ demoing, explaining
^ pushing feedback to engineers

---
TA in Mid-project
============
- Stable tools
- Small fixes
- Education
- Relationship building

^ -build relationships
	- see how we're doing
	- Good for our tech sides
	- but more important for other side
	- ANet story goes here

----
Good TA Service
==========
- Approachable
- Responsive
- Embedded 

^ Good service  boils down to relationships:
	-  be friendly
	-  be knowledgeable
	-  be helpful
	-  be responsive
	-  above all, be _there_
	- >> keep the joke about "if being a grouchy genius is needed, we have programmers for that"	

---
TA in Late production
===============
- It's all working
^  	big questions answered, big tools delivered

---
TA in Late production
===============
- It's all working
- Until disaster hits

^	- now is when shit hits the fan
		- all the guesses made in the dark get tested
		- many will be wrong
		- "rebuild all the physics message"
		- "quantize all the vertex colors"
		- "cnahge all of these p's to q's"

---
TA Disaster response
===================
- TA's are 'first responders' 
- Tech skills
- Automation
^	- this hits Ta's hardest
		- it comes with the territory
		-but there are good ways and bad ways
	 by definition, it's not planned
	- hard to improve, because every crisis is different
	- high time costs
	- unpredictable



---
Low investment trap
===============
- value the heroics
- don't take them granted
- gruntwork saps morale

^  too many companies choose the bad way
			- human wave attacks
			- drudgery
			- keeping people tasked out 100%
		- if you waste artists time on crap, you're doing it wrong
		- if you waste all TA time on crap, you're also doing it wrong!
	- right way:
		- good tools to minimize these crises
		- up fron investsments to make us more flexible
		- TA's who use automation
		- learn from mistakes
	- sometimes you have to do it anyway
	- but it's a mistake
	- wes g story
		- don't be a garbageman	
---
TA Disaster preparedness
==================
+ automation
+ open file formats
+ asset tracking
+ Defensive development

^ Key weapons are
	+ good tools
	+ automation 
	+ open file formats
	+ asset tracking
	+ Cynicism
		- "We just wont do that" rarely works
		-  when it does, it's not always a good thing


---
#Stop here
---
TA production lifecyle
=======================
- Balance shifts over time
- Good department is balanced
	- Tech
	- Relationships
	- Emergency services	


^  get the balance right
	- don't overdo tech
		- no ivory tower
	- don't overdo service
		- ta's must be innovating
	- don't overdo human waves.				 


---
Understanding  TA work
======================
- Four very different kinds of work
	- designing pipelines 
	- building systems
	- supporting artists
	- emergency management 

^ There's an infinity of details that I can't cover here, but all TAs work falls into one of 4 big categories 



----
![inline](http://www.flammerouge.je/images/factsheets/evolution.gif)
^ redo the graphic with the right heads

^ There's an infinity of details that I can't cover here, but all TAs work falls into one of r big categories 
^ tools = leonardo
^ pipelines = mr carson
^ support = the medic
^ emergencies = macgyver

--- 
What for?
========
- this all boills down to one basic job:
	- saving braincells

---
^ is this the right place?
![Steve jobs closet](http://allaboutstevejobs.com/persona/steveathome/05.jpg)

^ Creative thinking is a precious, finite resource
	+ don't waste it on BS stuff
	+ Focus on story, moood, character
	+ Not on file names, check boxes
	- All boil down to one big thing:
	+ Making artists more productive

---
> Creative decisions are a **finite** resource. 
Don't waste them on crap.

---
The right balance
=================
- strategy and tactics are **interdependent**
- don't lose sight of either
- the right balance between them is key!

^ it's important to emphasize that these two halves of TA depend on each other. Finding the right balance is a key to getting the most out of the department 

^ too much tactics doesn't achieve big savings or major new ways to work
		+ Often artists only want this, don't want bigger pictures stuff
	- too much strategy can leave the artists feeling abandoned and the TAs out of touch.
		+ Often TA's get too heads down, too much like 'programmers'


---
Strategy and tactics over time
==============================

+ balance shifts over the course of the project
	- prototype & design
	- implement & bulletproof
	- maintain & explain


^ edit the infographic so the right heads are on the right bodies....

Content Strategy 101
========================

^ theme : industry keeps shooting self in foot

- strategy is how you approach making your game
	- tools
	- workflows
	- expectations

---

Bad strategies
===============
- bad strategies are wasteful
	- awkward
	- fragile
	- mysterious
	- distractions

^ there's a million ways to do it wrong
^ but they all share some common features
^ they don't flow or don't work
^ you don't know how they work

---

![fit](http://thewrittenreference.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fart-3.jpg)

^ I could do this talk entirely on horror stories of how we waste people's creativity and energy

^ zipper levels
	- giant maya file

	- but they didn't!
	- tail chasing

^ the illusion of control is worst!
^ also: don't leave important decisions where they are going to get stomped

Passion
==========
* these are the kind of things we do to ourselves
* if you want to get the most out of your ta department,
	- find people who are *MAD* about this stuff
	- and let them loose to make things better

---
Hallmarks of bad strategy
===========================
* What is bad strategy? 
	- Could be bad tech, or just bad process
		+ usually it's both
		+ No matter how you get there the symptoms are the same
	+  process that is mysterious
		- Bungie materials story
	+  process that is too cumbersome
		- Valve materials story
	+ Workflows that get in the way of iteration
		- sluggish 
		- fragile or unreliable
	+ Workflows that aren't  collaborative
		- Ben W' Photoshop files
	+ In short: bad strategy gets in the way of artists doing their jobs
	+ Ta's are very passionate about these things
		- our job involves cleaning up after these messes
		- So we take a big interest in fixing them

---
Good strategy, courtesy of TA:
==============================
*  Good example of how TA's can drive a succesful strategy:
	-  Changing bungie character process
	-  Old way:
		+  iterate in concept
		+  model
		+  texture
		+  review & approve
		+  rig
		+  animate
		+  Oops! back to step 1!
	-  New way
		+  iterate in concept
		+  Massing model
		+  Concept animation
		+  Review and approve
		+  Texture
		+  Rig and animate
		+  Yay!

---		
hallmarks of good strategy
============================
- iterative
- good scopes
- clear
- robust


^ This slide needs tightening up

^  Strategy has many details, but good strategies...
	-  Are understandable!	
		-  TAs can help more, if they contribute more
		-  That's why I like this kind of exporter dialog ![1 button exporter dialog image]
		-  instead of this ![typical Fbx with all options visible]
	-  Are efficient
		+  One button and go is good
		+ But there are many other ways to make things efficient
			+  automatic naming and file placement
			+  visual browsers with tagging instead of folder hierarchies
			+  Search and replace in data files
	-  Are collaborative and iterative
		+  CTRL+G is good !

---
Strategy reprise
=================
- Pick the right battles 
- Your TAs should have
	+  Good understanding of tech
	+  Good workflow instincts
	+  Good negotiating skills
	+  No hand-waviness or over-optimism

---
TAs and strategy
=================	
*  TA's are good at strategy because
	-  They know both sides of the equation [#leonardo]
		+  Can talk to both sides
		+  Can help negotiate production decisions
			- Girling story
			-  Jeff's recolor story
				+  sometimes the two views are very different!
	-  They have production know-how 
		+  eating your own dogfood is good
			- TAs do; tools programmers usually don't
	-  They've usually seen the results of mistakes close up!
		+  bad decisions often land in our laps
		+  We know the hard truth:
			- no handshake agreement lasts
			- everything is iterative
			- yesterday's stretch goal is tomorrow's front line feature

---
Strategy and organization
==============================
-  Is TA a department or group?
-  Personally I don't much care
	-  if you're in a situation where TOE is important, you're probably already in trouble
-  However, heres one useful principle to keep in mind
	- You want the TAD in discussions where process is important!
		- new features
		- new workflows
		- scalability
	-  The key thing that matter is **making the team pay attention to artists time and how it is spent.**
	-  It it takes a title to do that, then great 	

---
Tactics
============
*  Segue: Now time for about tactics
-  Like strategy there are a million details we don't want to cover.
-  When I say tactics, you should hear "help" or "service"  #cleric
-   tactics matters
	+  small improvements are the core of the bond between TA and Art
	+  show that problems are understood
	+  and artist time is valued
	+  This is the most common form of tech-art
		-  in too many companies its the only form.
^ this needs a better transition

---
Tactics is the foundation of strategy
=======================================
-  To some degree it's just because little details matter
	+  All artists know that
	+  Saving a few seconds here or there, avoiding a minor annoyance can make a big psychological difference to your work
-	But more importantly, you need the intel
	+	You don't know what's going on if you're not in daily contact
		-	I struggle with this all the time...
		-	Artists don't report bugs!	
-   People don't always see the big strategic savings, but they see the little things.

---
Artists don't look out for themselves
=====================================
+  Artists are very conservative
+  Vulnerable to stockholm syndome
+  Example: Arena Net animations
	- Everthing in one file??
	- And if you change something at the beginning, you have to move all subsequent keys????
	- And.... NO ONE COMPLAINED.
	- People can be get used to everything
	- they missed East Germany
^ possible gimmicks: Ostalgia? 8-bit games? Both?

---
That's why you need to be out there...
=======================================
* Segue: Moral of the Anet story:
	- artists don't always stick up for themselves
	- you need to get their trust to make lives better 
	-  So you need to invest in tactics - aka, investing in service - to protect the ability of the strategy side to deliver
	-   If you want to implement new better workflows, you have to prove yourself to the artists

---
Being in the trenches
======================
*  Segue: since artists don't stick up for themselves, be proactive
	-  TAs need to spend time with their clients
		+  observing
		+  asking questions
		+  answering questions
		+  helping out
	-  If they lose touch they turn into just plain old tools programmers

---
Good tactics = good relationships
==================================
*  Good tactics boils down to relationships:
	-  be friendly
	-  be knowledgeable
	-  be helpful
	-  be responsive
	-  above all, be _there_
^ keep the joke about "if being a grouchy genius is needed, we have programmers for that"	

---
What an AD can look for:
==========================
* If your not in the trenches it's hard to judge those relationships...
	- but here are some things you can look for
- Does every crash generate an automatic email?
	- .. and do TA's respond?
- Are tools released with testing and validation
	- .. or just dumped into a network share?
- Do TA's know how to help?
	+ there are lots of forms
		+ Good person-to-person skills
		+ Asking good questions
		+ Prioritizing 	
		+ training and education
		+ docs...
- How Do TA's take and implement requests?
	+ is it transparent? Is it well managed
- in short: are the TA's in the trenches, helping out, and being part of the process day by day

Tactics reprise
=================
+ Good tactics is all keeping people happy and productive
	- close contacts
	- good relationships
	- sharing and collecting information
* Good tactics is the foundation of strategy
	- the information you learn in the trenches informs future decisions
	- the trust you build helps bring your artists along for the ride
+ The hardest task for TA's is balancing strategy and tactics
	- Strategy, like engineering, tends to take lots of time
	- tension between doing service and complex code
	- TA's need to resist temptation to vanish into the ether
		- constant contact is good for morale
		- constant contact gives TAs better knowledge of the problems
		- constant contact builds political capital!
	- Should be as embedded as possible

---
Crisis management
===================
* Seque:  we've talked about the balance between #strategy and #tactics
 	+ but, to extend the warmongering metaphor, "No plan survives contact the enemy"
	- The other big complicating factor in TA life is the balance between the planned and the unplanned.
	- Good strats will fail. 
	- Good service will not magic away production crises
	- Managing  crises is a *critical* part of TA

---
Sh*t Happens
==============
*  Sure, nobody expect's a crisis.  But they are inevitable
+ Most common strategies all have weaknesses:
	+ 'we won't do that' ?
		- oh yes you will	!
			- design and tech imperatives are all fluid
			- publishers, designers, and playtest feedback all have a say!
		- Moonrise character distances
		- SOD cinematics
	+ 'this tool will make that not a problem'
		- tools are software. All software has bugs
		- tools have long lead times, can't adapt to sudden changes
			- eg, UE 4 removes script support
		- tools, like games, don't arrive on time.
	+ 'our engine is perfect'
		- no its not
		- the 'perfect' description of the finished game != the perfect working environment
			- eg, Bungie tags
		- too optimized data is hard to change. 
- in short: things will go wrong

TA = FEMA
==========
- When things go bad, TA is the first line of defence
	- Because we know the pipeline
	- Because we can free up artists to make more art
	- Because we have tools and techniques to make this less brutal

---
Disaster response is a tough job
===================================
- by definition, it's not planned
	- hard to improve, because every crisis is different
	- high time costs
	- unpredictable
- it's tempting to pawn it off on the unfortunate
	+ some companies have whole departments that do nothing but scut work
	+ There are some amazing people in those roles
	+ but it's a tragic waste
- Disaster response is a high skill job, not a low 
	- ta's have to maximize their own productivity so they can maximise yours

---
Disaster preparedness
=====================
- Up front investments
	- people skills
		- all TAs need to be able to do their own automation, full stop  [#macgyver]
		- scripting < hard core programming, but it's essential
		-it's the only way to speed up massive drudge work
	- open file formats
		+ ex: level search and replace
	- automatable tools
		+ no tool is front line ready if it doesn't have production flexibility
		+ Maya example: everything is scriptable; vs old Max.
	- asset tracking and metadata
		+ all forms of automation work easier with this
	- Prevent bad source data
		- p4 triggers to exclude bad files
		- warn on out-of-date files
		-  can't check in files with bad references, etc.
-   Cynicism
	- "We just wont do that" rarely works
	-  when it does, it's not always a good thing

---
Be prepared!
============
* Important difference: Disaster prep vs lurching from one crisis to another  
	- production always involves crises
	- TA's should be there to do the worst cleanup work
	- **BUT** working this way all the time is a failure
		+ It's demoralizing for TAs
		+ It enables bad behavior in other departments
	- Wes G. anecdote
	+ You’ll lose good people if you give them awful work to do
		- true for artists too!
	- Like Normandy beach -sometimes you have to make a frontal assault
		- But if you do it every time you’ll be defeated
		- back reference to #strategy.
---
	+ Reminder: close contact with art is the key
		- You need this for three reasons
	 		- Can't do good tactics if you don't know the customers
			- Can't do good strategy if you don't know the way things are made
			- In the crises you need to be able to pitch in where needed, business card be damned
		- Don't want to waltz in with no knowledge of ground truths
---
Conclusion
===========
-	TA is a complex role
-	Short history, no easy models to use
-	Boils down to a simple idea:
	+	TAs are there to make other people more productive

Getting the most out of TA's
============================
- Make good use of their ability to drive content strategy
	+   better tools and workflows
	+   avoiding bad decisions
- Build close relationships between TA and art
	+ constant contact
	+ good service from TAs
	+ buy-in from art
- Be prepared for crises
	+ Assume things will go wrong, plan accordingly
	+ But don't use that as an excuse for drudgery
